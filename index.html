        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello there, my name is Edgar Alberto Valenzuela and My main goal/dream is to be a professional soccer player with the hopes of competing in the big leagues. Through my Soccer adventures/journie I have competed against professional teams and big league youth academy teams. I prepare myself everyday until I can reach my goal of becoming a professional soccer player. I train mentally and physically almost every day so I can open those doors to my opportunity while increasing my potential everyday. It is something I love to do and will always love to do as it's my passion that I pursue everyday. I have learned so much from Soccer and have been able to benefit from it through such as life tasks. It has helped make me who I am today and I hope to achieve my dream one day no matter the obstacle I am bound to achieve it. I have suppressed many people whether it be spectators watching me play to semi-pro players and college players and as well as amazing level coaches whether it be club/academy/or college level. I am yet to achieve my goal/dream but I know I'm close to every step in my journey. I get closer towards my dream. But at the end of the day I give all glory to God as he is my life and strength and the reason I am so successful and amazing at what I do. He's given a blessing that probably not anyone has. Although the journey has only started it's crazy to believe how my life went from 0-100 real quick. I'm still young and there are yet more things to come as well as new opportunities.<br><br>

        A second Interest that I have is the business/marketing field with many lessons to be learned from it. There are many careers that can be chosen through this field and I hope to be in one myself in the future. Like mentioned many lessons can be taught through this field and it can make a lot of money while having some nice benefits. Things with little to no value can be changed to something that can be worth millions with the help of marketing and business which can help create a healthier economy which is something that really interests me. With such interest in that area, a job I would like myself is to be a Real Estate Agent/Broker which requires a lot of critical thinking to help keep the cost at a reasonable amount while providing quality property to clients as you try to make profit from what you sell. Essentially something Like house flipping would be something I would like to do as you can design, remodel/renovate, and really express your creativity. I feel like I'd fit as I have many skills that can help me with this career such as creativeness, good decision making , etc. This business/marketing field is something I'm really interested in taking as I'm currently majoring in it and hope I can get a career in such an area.<br><br>
